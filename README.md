## My process

### Where to find resources

The first think to do is to look for your perfect design! So let's checkout [dribble](https://dribbble.com/) our favourite design to begin!

### Built with

- Reactjs
- Axios
- styled modules
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the project. So if you got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a try. However, i wrote this design with simple html5 and css and made it responsive for all the devices, since my users should be able to: View the optimal layout

### What I learned

This projects helped me being more familiar with the details of react, its hooks, components, hosting and API, and  create a responsive project with small details on colors,sizes and so on.

To see parts of my codes and see how you can add code snippets, see below:

``` JSX

   useEffect(()=>{

        const fetchAPI = async () => {
            const data = await getCoin();
            setCoins(data);
            console.log(data);
        };
        fetchAPI();

    },[]);

    const handleSearch = (event)=>{
        setSearch(event.target.value)
    }

    const searchedCoins = coins.filter( coin => coin.name.toLowerCase().includes(search.toLowerCase()));


    const Coin = ({name,symbol,image,marketCapChange,price,marketCap}) =>{
        return(
            <>
                <div className={styles.container}>
                    <img src={image} alt={name} className={styles.image} />
                    <span className={styles.name}>{name}</span>
                    <span className={styles.symbol}>{symbol.toUpperCase()}</span>
                    <span className={styles.currentPrice}>$ {price.toLocaleString()}</span>
                    <span className={marketCapChange > 1 ? styles.greenPriceChange : styles.redPriceChange}>{marketCapChange.toFixed(2)}</span>
                    <span className={styles.symbol}>$ {marketCap.toLocaleString()}</span>
                </div>
            </>
        );
    }


```
```css
      
  .symbol {
    text-align: left;
    width: 100px;
    color: #cdcbcb;
  }
  
  .currentPrice {
    text-align: left;
    width: 100px;
    color: #cdcbcb;
  }
  
```
